This is only the ideal case, of course, and any developer from an amateur to a professional knows that actually creating a web app and deploying it is full of trial and error. It's important to understand that in this situation we're using <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js\">this repository.</a> My primary thoughts on the matter would simply be to add that we need to remember not to use the <em>npx serverless</em> command and rather to change it to just <em>serverless</em>. You should also probably be using linux rather than Windows as the latter caused me quite a few issues. At least what I can say is that having a windows username seperated by spaces is not ideal. After you install the serverless framework (I used <em>git [repositorylink]</em>), you'll need to make a very simple modification to your serverless.yml to add the component name; you can find the documentation on this in the GitHub's README. Once you do that you can set the AWS credentials with your preffered method whether that be in the CLI or in an AWS CONFIG FILE. Then you can test your app with <em>npm run dev</em> or you can deploy your app with <em>serverless</em>.</p>\n<h2>Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Serverless is a versatile and scalable framework for deploying next.js apps and I couldn't recommend it more highly to developers new and professional alike. It's a significant advantage to have such an easy framework. For example, serverless.yml doesn't have that many options and so there's only so much you can do when you deploy, meaning you don't have to worry endlessly that you messed something up, you can find a full list <a href=\"https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml/\">here</a>. In addition, the architecture behind it is concise and quick and statically serving pages is a step up from your typical website. The ability to set caching standards before deployment saves the hassle of creating an entire backend for your simple test site just to change caching behavior.</p>\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/dynamic-routing/logo.gif"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/dynamic-routing/logo.gif"}},"__N_SSG":true}
